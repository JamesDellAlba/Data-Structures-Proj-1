# Data-Structures-Proj-1

This is a school assignment for my Data Structures class where I implement insertion sort, selection sort, sequential search, and binary search over an array of objects.
I also practice writing Javadoc comments.
This program must have the Countries1.csv file in the same directory as /src/ in order to work.
